# Dzisja
Simple android app created to help people keep track of  their feelings.
## About Dzisja
This is the v2 (2019) version of my Everyday (app created back in 2018). 
Both Apps share similar funcionality but different architecture.
This is my university side-project, that I had to create to pass one of the courses. 
I decided to recreate my older app, because it is easy to 
determine features that need to be implemented and it allows me to go on with TDD approach. 
During development process of Dzisja I would like to learn and practice how to  
* write <b>JUnit, Mockito, Espresso tests</b>, basically follow <b>TDD approach</b> 
* use Kotlin coroutines
* use Dagger2
* use MotionLayout to get better at providing good user experience
